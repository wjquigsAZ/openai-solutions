# RAG with Bedrock Knowledge Bases: retrieve then generate with citations

You have documents in a Bedrock Knowledge Base and you want a GPT-5.6 model to answer
questions grounded in that corpus — with inline citations that trace every claim back to a source. Bedrock offers a coupled `RetrieveAndGenerate` API, but you want control: custom
prompting, citation formatting, model choice independent of retrieval, and room to add
reranking or business logic between the two steps.

```

The two-step separation means you can independently tune retrieval (number of results,
hybrid search, metadata filters) and generation (model choice, system prompt, reasoning
effort) without either side affecting the other.

## Why two steps instead of `RetrieveAndGenerate`

Bedrock's `RetrieveAndGenerate` couples both halves into one API call, which is
convenient but limits you:

- You cannot choose the generation model independently — it uses a Bedrock-managed model.
- You cannot inspect or filter chunks between retrieval and generation.
- You cannot format citations your way, inject business logic, or add a reranking step.
- You cannot use the OpenAI Responses API features (structured output, reasoning effort).

The two-step pattern gives you the managed vector search of Knowledge Bases with the full power of GPT-5.6 on generation, authenticated through the same AWS credential chain.

## Prerequisites

- The [prerequisites in the cookbooks README](../../README.md).
- **An existing Bedrock Knowledge Base** with documents already ingested. You need its
  Knowledge Base ID (looks like `XXXXXXXXXX`). See [Appendix A](#appendix-a---creating-a-knowledge-base) for help creating a knowledge base.
- **`bedrock:Retrieve` permission** on the Knowledge Base ARN. This is separate from the
  inference permission.
- **`boto3`** for the Retrieve API call. It is already in the base cookbook dependencies —
  `uv sync` installs it.

## Run it

```bash
uv sync
cp .env.example .env   # set KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID and AWS_REGION

uv run --env-file .env python \
  03-grounding-and-multimodal/04-rag-with-knowledge-bases/python/rag_with_knowledge_bases.py
```

Pass a custom query as a positional argument:

```bash
uv run python \
  03-grounding-and-multimodal/04-rag-with-knowledge-bases/python/rag_with_knowledge_bases.py \
  "What are the effects of vessel noise on marine communication?"
```

## How it works

### Step 1: Retrieve

The script calls the Bedrock Knowledge Bases `Retrieve` API directly with the user's
query. This returns ranked chunks with relevance scores and source locations (S3 URIs or
web URLs). You control `k` (number of results) and can enable hybrid search or metadata
filters.

### Step 2: Build numbered context

Each retrieved chunk is numbered `[1]`, `[2]`, ... and concatenated into a single context
string. The numbering scheme is what enables inline citations — the model can reference a specific chunk by its number.

### Step 3: Generate with citation instructions

The numbered context and the user's question are passed to GPT-5.6 via the Responses API
with a system prompt that constrains the model to:

- Answer only from the provided context
- Cite sources inline as `[n]` matching the context block numbers
- Say so explicitly if the context does not contain the answer

### Step 4: Return answer and citation map

The answer and a mapping from citation numbers to source URIs are returned together, so a caller can render references however it needs.

## Example output

```

   model             openai.gpt-5.6-terra
   region            us-east-1

   retrieval_k       6
   max_output_tokens 1024
   store             False

← retrieval
   chunks returned   6
   top score         0.73

← generation
   Vessel noise has been shown to significantly impact oyster toadfish
   acoustic communication. Studies demonstrate that toadfish modify their
   calling behavior in the presence of boat noise [1], reducing call rates
   and shifting dominant frequencies [3].

```

## Production considerations

- **Cap output tokens.** The generation call should always set `max_output_tokens`. Without
  it, a verbose answer on a large context can bill far more than you expect.
- **Tune `k` deliberately.** More chunks means more grounding material but also more input
  tokens — and on a large corpus, lower-ranked chunks add noise without adding signal.
  Start with 5–6 and measure citation coverage.
- **Consider hybrid search.** For queries with specific terms (product names, error codes),
  adding `"overrideSearchType": "HYBRID"` improves recall by combining keyword and semantic
  search.
- **Add deduplication.** If your corpus has overlapping documents, multiple chunks from the
  same source inflate the context without adding information. Deduplicate by source URI
  before building context.
- **Consider reranking.** A cross-encoder reranker between retrieve and generate can
  significantly improve precision when `k` is high. Bedrock supports this natively via
  reranking configuration.
- **Handle the "I don't know" case.** The system prompt tells the model to say when context
  is insufficient. In production, detect that response and route to a fallback rather than surfacing it raw.
- **Print Region and model.** Explicit logging prevents silent Region drift across
  environments — the same code running in `us-west-2` might hit a different KB or miss a
  model tier.

## Data handling and security

- **No API key in the code.** Both the Retrieve call (boto3) and the generation call
  (OpenAI provider) use the AWS credential chain.
- **`store=False` on generation**, so AWS retains neither the prompt nor the response.
- **Retrieval is read-only.** The `Retrieve` API does not modify your Knowledge Base or its
  source documents.
- **Context stays in-Region.** Both the retrieval and generation calls execute in the Region you configure, and the retrieved chunks are not sent outside it.
- **The Knowledge Base ID is configuration, not a secret.** It identifies a resource in your account but does not grant access — IAM does.
- **Chunks may contain sensitive content** from your corpus. The script prints them to
  stdout for teaching purposes; a production deployment should treat retrieved text as
  potentially sensitive.

## Limitations and non-goals

- **It does not create a Knowledge Base.** You bring one that already has documents
  ingested. The [Bedrock Knowledge Bases documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base.html) covers creation and ingestion.
- **It does not stream.** The answer arrives in one piece. Add `stream=True` to the
  `responses.create` call for token-by-token delivery — the [streaming recipe](../../01-foundations/05-streaming/) covers the event types.
- **It does not maintain conversation history.** Each call is stateless. Appending prior
  Q&A pairs to the context is straightforward but outside this recipe's scope.
- **It does not evaluate answer quality.** The [scoring recipe](../02-scoring-a-grounded-answer/) covers grounding evaluation.
- **Citation accuracy depends on the model following instructions.** The numbered-context
  pattern is reliable but not guaranteed — production systems should validate that cited numbers exist in the context.

## Clean up

There is nothing to tear down. Retrieval is read-only, generation uses `store=False`, and
no resources are created. Your Knowledge Base and its documents are unaffected.

## Next steps

- [`03-grounding-and-multimodal/01-grounded-regulatory-monitoring/`](../01-grounded-regulatory-monitoring/)
  — grounding with Bedrock's native Web Search instead of your own corpus.
- [`03-grounding-and-multimodal/02-scoring-a-grounded-answer/`](../02-scoring-a-grounded-answer/)
  — measuring whether an answer is faithful to its sources.
- [`02-reasoning-and-output/01-structured-claims-intake/`](../../02-reasoning-and-output/01-structured-claims-intake/)
  — adding a structured output schema so you can programmatically detect "I don't know."
- [`01-foundations/05-streaming/`](../../01-foundations/05-streaming/) — streaming the generation for real-time delivery.

## Appendix A - Creating a Knowledge Base

Start with a set of documents, either in a zip file or in an S3 bucket. You then have
three options: console, API, or Codex. The [Bedrock Knowledge Bases creation documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base-create.html) describes how to manually configure a knowledge base using both the console and the API.

However, given that we have configured the AWS MCP server, it's also possible to prompt Codex to create the knowledge base on its own. Here is a sample prompt:

> Using documentation linked here as necessary
> ([docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base-create.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base-create.html)), use AWS MCP tools to create a knowledge base from the attached set of documents. Get input for any ambiguous choices, for example vector store.

Attach the documents, or a link to the S3 bucket where the documents are stored.
